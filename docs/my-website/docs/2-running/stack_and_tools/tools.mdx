Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a lightweight, open-source code editor developed by Microsoft. It is a popular choice among developers due to its extensibility and support for a wide range of programming languages and technologies.

VSCode can be downloaded and installed from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for Windows, Mac, and Linux. The installation process is straightforward and should take only a few minutes to complete.

:::note
You can use other Editors like Android Studio, but it is recommended to use Visual Studio Code as the code editor since it's easy to use and very helpful.
