## VScode

Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a lightweight, open-source code editor developed by Microsoft. It is a popular choice among developers due to its extensibility and support for a wide range of programming languages and technologies.

VSCode can be downloaded and installed from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for Windows, Mac, and Linux. The installation process is straightforward and should take only a few minutes to complete.

!!!note
You can use other Editors like Android Studio, but it is recommended to use Visual Studio Code as the code editor since it's easy to use and very helpful.
