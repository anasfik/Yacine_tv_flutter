# Running Backend Server

## Installation

1. Open the `/server` folder.

2. Open a terminal (cmd or powershell..) in the path of that folder (`/server`).

3. Run the command `npm install` to install the required dependencies.

:::note
This will install the rest of the required dependencies for the server such as Express.js, MangoDB Driver...
:::

4. Now, look inside the `/server` that you did opened, you should find a `.env.example` file which contains those variables:

```JS
MANGODB_URI=YOUR_MANGODB_CLUSTER_URI
PORT=8080
```

5. Replace `YOUR_MANGODB_CLUSTER_URI` with your MangoDB cluster URI.

:::tip
The MangoDB cluster URI looks something like : `mongodb+srv://gwhyyy:password@cluster0.ktg0sfb.mongodb.net/...`.
:::

:::tip
If you don't know how to get your cluster, please give a quick look over [`How To`](../../how_to) section, it contains many short tutorials related to configuring this project.
:::

6. Optional: Replace the `PORT` with that you want to open a localhost with, Example when running the server locally, it's url will be `localhost:8080`.

7. Rename the `.env.example` file name to `.env`.

8. Run the command `npm start` to run the Express.js server.

## Verification

To ensure that the backend server is running correctly, you can perform the following verification steps:

1. Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:<port>` (replace `<port>` with the port number specified in the `.env` file).

2. You should see a message indicating that the server is running.

## When I should Go To Next Step ?

When you have in your hands the `localhost:<PORT>` running successfully, then **congratulations**, you can now pass to the next step where you will learn how to create an admin account to use it.
