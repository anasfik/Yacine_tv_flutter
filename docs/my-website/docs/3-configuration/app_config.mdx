# Configuration Variables

## Config File

Inside the app folder, navigate to this file:

```
lib/config/general/config.dart`
```

This file contains a set of variables and configurations that are used throughout app.

### Why it exists inside the project, and not configurable from th Admin Panel ?

The answer is simple, it should be that way, the configurations inside this file are related directly to the source code of the app, like declaring assets paths, app behaviors...

# Configuration Variables

Below is an explanation of each variable and its purpose.

## `environmentFilePath`

```dart
static String environmentFilePath = '.env';
```

This variable specifies the path of the environment file that contains the environment-specific configurations. This file is typically used to store sensitive information such as API keys and should not be committed to source control.

Well you don't need to change this if you did followed this documentation exactly like it says, just in case you wanted to change the `.env` file emplacement to another folder, you will need to change it's path from this variable as well.

## `lightThemePath`

```dart
static String lightThemePath = 'assets/theme.json';
```

This variable specifies the path of the JSON file that contains the light theme configuration generated by [appainter.dev](appainter.dev). This file is used to define the color scheme and other visual elements of the app.

## `menuImageCoverToShowWhenOriginalOneFails`

```dart
static String menuImageCoverToShowWhenOriginalOneFails = 'assets/YOUR_IMAGE.png';
```

This variable specifies the path of the image that will be displayed as replacement of the menu cover when it fails to load ( in case of it have an invalid image link).

## `backgroundAsset`

```
static String backgroundAsset = "assets/background.jpg";
```

This variable specifies the path of the background image that is used in the application.

## `loadMenuItemsLazily`

```dart
static bool loadMenuItemsLazily = false;
```

This variable is a boolean that determine whether the menu items should be loaded lazily or not. If it's `true`, the menu items will be loaded only when the user open to the menu.

## `loadAppSettingsLazily`

```dart

```

```

## `autoPlay`

```

```

This variable is a boolean that determine whether the player should be play the live streams as soon as it's opened, or to let it to be played manually from the user.

## `initialSettings`
