# Running Backend Server

## Installation

1. Open the server folder.

2. Open a terminal (cmd or powershell..) in the path of that folder.

3. Run the command `npm install` to install the required dependencies.

4. Create a new file in the root of the project called `.env` and add the following environment variables:

```JS
DB_URL : the MongoDB connection string.
PORT : the port on which the server will run.
```

5. Run the command `npm start` to start the Express.js server.

## Verification

To ensure that the backend server is running correctly, you can perform the following verification steps:

1. Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:<port>` (replace `<port>` with the port number specified in the .env file).

2. You should see a message indicating that the server is running.

3. Test the API endpoints by making a request to them, you should see the data in the response if the server is running correctly and the connection to the database is successful.
