# Running Admin Panel

## Installation

1. open the Admin Panel folder.

2. Open a terminal inside the path of that folder.

3. Run the command `flutter pub get` to install the required dependencies.

4. Create a new file in the root of the project called `.env` and add the following environment variable:

```
API_URL: the URL of the server you did got following the Backend section steps.
```

5. Run the project in the browser (Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge) and wait until it compile, alternatively run the command `flutter run --web-browser` from the folder path.

Verification:

1. The admin panel should be opened automatically on the browser properly.
2. You can then authenticate with the username and password you did create in the previous guide.
