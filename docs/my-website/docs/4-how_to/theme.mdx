# Changing the App Theme

I am using a more flexible way to change the theme of the app using a website tool which is (https://appainter.dev/). This tool allows you to customize various visual elements of the app such as colors, fonts, and more. Once you have made your desired changes, the tool will generate a JSON file of the theme that can be used in the app.

## Using the Theme Generator Tool

1. Visit the theme generator website (https://appainter.dev/#/)
2. Use the tool's interface to customize the visual elements of the app to your liking.
3. Once you are satisfied with your changes, click the export button.
4. Download the generated JSON file of the theme.

## Applying the Generated Theme

1. Copy the downloaded JSON file of the theme to the `assets` folder in the root of your app's directory.
2. In the `config.dart` file, change the `lightThemePath` variable to the path of the JSON file.

```dart
static String lightThemePath = 'assets/YOUR_THEME.json';
```
