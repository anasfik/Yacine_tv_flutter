# Change The App Icon

in order to changing the app icon name, we're going to use the [flutter_launcher_icons](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_launcher_icons) package that simplifies the task for you.

- 1- take your icon image, copy it.
- 2- from the app project folder, open the `assets/` folder.
- 3- paste the icon inside of it, we will need the name of the icon.
- 4- Now, from the app project directory, search for the `pubspec.yaml` file.
- 5- Open it, then add the following like this:

```dart {2, 4-8}
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_launcher_icons: "^0.11.0"

flutter_icons:
  android: "launcher_icon"
  ios: true
  image_path: "assets/<NAME_OF_YOUR_ICON_HERE>"
  min_sdk_android: 21 # android min sdk min:16, default 21

```

:::caution Warning
Be careful with empty spaces inside the `pubspec.yaml`, this file is sensitive with them, an extra/less space will cause failure in next step
:::

- 6- open the cmd (command line), then run these commands:

```
flutter pub get
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main
```

- 7- That's it, now run or build your app and you should see the app icon changed.
